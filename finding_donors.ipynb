    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Weaknesses:  Naive Bayes is \"naive\" and assumes that features are independent of and unrelated to each other.  Consequently if data features are very related to each other, Naive Bayes may not fit the data well.  For instance, in email classification (as mentioned above), Naive Bayes disregards word order in an email.\n",

For instance, if capital-gain is dependent on age; the correlation is most likely uniform and not very erratic (i.e. as age goes up, capital-gain goes up).  As a result, the model would pseudo treat them as the same thing without even knowing it and result in the same classification.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Based on the previous evaluation, the best model to use will be the Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it performs better than the other two models in regards to both accuracy and F0.5 score.  The Naive Bayes only achieves a 0.6 accuracy score, performing significantly worse than both the Decision Tree Classifier and SVM.  The Decision Tree Classifier performs similarly to the SVM in regards to accuracy but performs markedly lower in regards to F0.5 score.  In the end, the SVM performs best; however, this performance comes at a price.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the SVM performs best in accuracy and F0.5 score, it has a substantially longer training/prediction time.  Both the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier only took less than 5 seconds to train on 100 percent of the data.  The SVM, on the other hand, took 100 seconds to train on 100 percent of the data, which is over 90 percent longer than the other models’ training times.  If working with a larger dataset or tight deadline, it might be advisable to use the Decision Tree Classifier instead of the SVM.  Considering this project lacks such constraints, SVM is the best model to use here because it performs well and seems to be suitable for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM is suitable for the data because there seems to an underlying high level of complexity to the data.  This underlying high level of complexity can be inferred from the Naive Bayes having a low accuracy score, implying dependencies in the feature space that are breaking the Naive Bayes classifier.  Such dependencies are able to be accounted for in the SVM (albeit with a high training/prediction time), making it very suitable for the data.\n"

    "Imagine you have a bunch of pink and blue balloons floating in your office, and pink balloons represent potential donors who make more than 50K while blue balloons represent poor donor candidates who make at most 50K.  Now the balloons are all mixed up in the air, floating at different heights, and frozen in place because the location of each balloon (candidate) represents a different combination of candidate features (i.e. Marital Status, Age, Occupation, etc…).  A Support Vector Machine is like a floating net that forms around the pink balloons, weaving through the air to separate the two colors, telling us what combination of candidate features represent a potential donor who makes more than 50K.\n",

The difference between accuracy scores is 0.0020, and the difference between F0.5 scores is 0.0046.

    "**Answer:**  Considering Education-Num and Education effectively measure the same thing (level of education), three out of my five guesses were correct:  Age, Education, and Capital Gain.  The two features that were extracted from `feature_importances_` that surprised me are Marital-Status and Hours-Per-Week.  I hypothesize Hours-Per-Week is an important feature, because people typically make more money if they work more hours per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Hours-Per-Week is easy to understand, Marital-Status is sort of perplexing.  On one hand you could guess that people who are married have a higher household income, but the data doesn't explicitly make it clear as to whether the label space (income) refers to individual or household income.  On another hand you could guess that single people have the potential to make more money if they are workaholics and forego relationships in the pursuit of career progress.  In the end it might be worth it to drill down into the data and Decision Tree to determine the exact relationship between Marital-Status, Hours-Per-Week, and Income."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**  Reducing the data causes a drop in both accuracy and F0.5 score, but the drop is very small.  The difference in accuracy is 0.0012, and the difference in F0.5 score is 0.0008.  As such, if training time were a factor, data reduction should be implemented because data reduction would save time and perform effectively just as well as training on the full dataset.  In other words:  the cost of data reduction is very small in this scenario."
